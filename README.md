#HelpDesk

This project was made out of an existing case by Jorge Sant Ana (e-learning course teacher) using PHP.
It is a help desk platform where users can sign/log in to open a ticket reporting technology issues, like hardware malfunction , for example.
For now, this project has only academic purposes. Feel free to contribute and learn from it!
